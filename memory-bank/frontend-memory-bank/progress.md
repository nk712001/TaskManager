# Frontend Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - Created `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, and `.eslintignore` in the frontend root.
  - Installed all required dependencies for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript/React integration.
  - Added scripts for linting, formatting, and type checking to `package.json`.
  - Set up Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit code quality enforcement.
  - Manually created `.husky/pre-commit` to run lint-staged before each commit.
- [x] Set up absolute imports
  - Added `baseUrl` and `paths` to `tsconfig.app.json` for all major src subdirectories.
  - Updated `vite.config.ts` to add matching alias entries for Vite.
  - Created a test component (`TestAbsoluteImport.tsx`) and imported it using an absolute import in `App.tsx`.
  - Visually validated absolute imports in the running app.
- [x] Install core dependencies
  - Installed: react-router-dom@^6, axios, @tanstack/react-query, zod, react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, antd, @ant-design/icons, styled-components, @storybook/react, cypress, @types/styled-components, @types/react-router-dom, @types/jest, react-error-boundary.
  - All packages are now listed in package.json and ready for use.
- [x] Configure Docker for development
  - Added multi-stage Dockerfile for dev and prod builds (Node/Vite for dev, Nginx for prod)
  - Created .dockerignore to optimize build context
  - Added docker-compose.yml with health checks and hot-reloading for dev, mapped prod to port 3000
  - Created nginx.conf for SPA routing and API proxying
  - Validation: Both dev and prod containers start, app accessible on ports 5173 (dev) and 3000 (prod), build errors fixed, port conflicts resolved.

## Phase 2: Authentication
- [x] Set up Auth Context
  - Implemented `AuthContext` and `AuthProvider` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
  - Added TypeScript types for user and tokens.
  - Implemented login/logout with 'Remember Me' (stores credentials in localStorage if checked).
  - Handles JWT access/refresh tokens and session timeout (auto-logout after 30 minutes).
  - Provided a `useAuth` hook for consuming authentication state and actions in any component.
  - Auth state is persisted and restored from localStorage on mount.
  - Error and loading states are managed in context for UI feedback.
  - All logic follows the implementation plan and is ready for protected route integration.
- [x] Implement login page
  - Created `Login.tsx` in `src/pages/auth` with Ant Design UI, Zod validation, and React Hook Form integration.
  - Used `Controller` for all fields to guarantee type safety and avoid undefined errors with Zod.
  - Polished UI: centered card, gradient background, logo, and error handling.
  - Fixed all "expected string, received undefined" issues with controlled fields.
  - Downgraded React to 18.x for Ant Design v5 compatibility.
- [x] Implement registration page
  - Created `Register.tsx` in `src/pages/auth` with Ant Design UI, Zod validation, React Hook Form integration, and API call to `/api/auth/register`.
  - Used `Controller` for all fields to guarantee type safety and avoid undefined errors with Zod.
  - UI and validation match login page style, with error handling and loading states.
  - Added `/register` route to router and ensured correct navigation.
  - Configured Vite proxy to forward `/api` requests to backend for local development.
- [x] Set up protected routes
  - Created `PrivateRoute` component in `src/components/common/PrivateRoute.tsx` to guard routes that require authentication.
  - Used the `useAuth` hook to check authentication state and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`, preserving the intended destination.
  - Wrapped the Dashboard route in `router.tsx` with `PrivateRoute` to ensure only authenticated users can access the main app.
  - Added a loading state for protected routes while auth state is being determined.
## Phase 3: Core Layout
- [x] Create main layout components
  - Created `AppLayout` component with responsive design
  - Implemented `Header` with user menu and navigation
  - Added `Sidebar` with navigation links
  - Created `Footer` with copyright information
- [x] Implement responsive navigation
  - Sidebar now renders as a Drawer on mobile and as a fixed Sider on desktop.
  - Header displays a hamburger menu button on mobile to open the sidebar Drawer.
  - Layout and content margins adapt for mobile/desktop using Ant Design's useBreakpoint.
  - Fixed mobile layout to eliminate left margin gap; content now uses full width on small screens.
- [ ] Set up theme provider
