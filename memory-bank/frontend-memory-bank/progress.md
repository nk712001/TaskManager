# Frontend Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - Created `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, and `.eslintignore` in the frontend root.
  - Installed all required dependencies for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript/React integration.
  - Added scripts for linting, formatting, and type checking to `package.json`.
  - Set up Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit code quality enforcement.
  - Manually created `.husky/pre-commit` to run lint-staged before each commit.
- [x] Set up absolute imports
  - Added `baseUrl` and `paths` to `tsconfig.app.json` for all major src subdirectories.
  - Updated `vite.config.ts` to add matching alias entries for Vite.
  - Created a test component (`TestAbsoluteImport.tsx`) and imported it using an absolute import in `App.tsx`.
  - Visually validated absolute imports in the running app.
- [x] Install core dependencies
  - Installed: react-router-dom@^6, axios, @tanstack/react-query, zod, react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, antd, @ant-design/icons, styled-components, @storybook/react, cypress, @types/styled-components, @types/react-router-dom, @types/jest, react-error-boundary.
  - All packages are now listed in package.json and ready for use.
- [x] Configure Docker for development
  - Added multi-stage Dockerfile for dev and prod builds (Node/Vite for dev, Nginx for prod)
  - Created .dockerignore to optimize build context
  - Added docker-compose.yml with health checks and hot-reloading for dev, mapped prod to port 3000
  - Created nginx.conf for SPA routing and API proxying
  - Validation: Both dev and prod containers start, app accessible on ports 5173 (dev) and 3000 (prod), build errors fixed, port conflicts resolved.

## Phase 2: Authentication
- [x] Set up Auth Context
  - Implemented `AuthContext` and `AuthProvider` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
  - Added types for user and tokens, login/logout with 'Remember Me', JWT/refresh token management (mocked), session timeout, and `useAuth` hook for access in components.
